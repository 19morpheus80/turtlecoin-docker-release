This is a series of docker files and related scripts I wrote.
I share them in the hope that they are useful for someone else.

Files included:

docker-compose.yml          - for running the container as a service (not used yet)
Dockerfile                  - to build the docker image
docker_prep                 - updates your system using apt, then installs docker and adds your current user to the docker group
installupdate_docker        - script downloads the latest turtlecoin binary release from github and (re)builds the docker image with it
install_update_git_release  - script called by installupdate_docker (grabs the latest release from github)
run_background_docker       - runs the docker image non-interactively.  probably shouldn't be used
run_interactive_docker      - runs the docker image interactively.  could be useful for having a look around

At present it goes like:

1. ./docker_prep
2. ./installupdate_docker
3. ./run_detached_docker "/turtlecoin/TurtleCoind --data-dir=/data --load-checkpoints=/turtlecoin/checkpoints.csv"
