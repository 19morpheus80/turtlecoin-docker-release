NOTE:  Currently making improvements to the scripts with regards to pre-requesits and error checking.

This is a series of docker files and related scripts I wrote.
I share them in the hope that they are useful for someone else.

Files included:

docker-compose.yml          - for running the container as a service (not used yet)
Dockerfile                  - to build the docker image
docker_prep                 - updates your system using apt, then installs docker and adds your current user to the docker group
installupdate_docker        - script downloads the latest turtlecoin binary release from github and (re)builds the docker image with it
install_update_git_release  - script called by installupdate_docker (grabs the latest release from github)
run_detached_docker         - runs the docker image non-interactively.  this is the one for running the daemon
run_interactive_docker      - runs the docker image interactively.  could be useful for having a look around

At present it goes like:

1. ./docker_prep
2. ./installupdate_docker
3. edit your start_public_node script
4. ./start_public_node

Use `docker logs --tail 20 --follow turtlecoind` to see the logs.

5. ./installupdate_docker at any time to update the binaries
6. ./stop_public_node to stop the service
7. ./start_public_node restarts an updated docker image
